Loco is "Rust on Rails".

Loco is strongly inspired by Rails. If you know Rails and Rust, you'll feel at home. If you only know Rails and new to Rust, you'll find Loco refreshing. We do not assume you know Rails.

To work with Loco, you need to know Rust to a beginner-moderate level. There are no crazy lifetime twisters and most of the development will be linear: request handling, workers, tasks, etc.

## Quick Start

```sh
$ cargo install loco-cli

check docker status
```
 docker ps --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Status}}';date
```

Now you can create your new app (choose "Saas app").

```sh
$ loco new
❯ App name? [myapp]:
❯ Saas app (with DB and user auth)
  Stateless service (minimal, no db)
🚂 Loco app generated successfully in:
myapp
```

<div class="infobox">
To configure a database , please run a local postgres database with <code>loco:loco</code> and a db named <code>[insert app]_development.</code>.
</div>

When generating a starter, the database name incorporates your application name and the environment. For instance, if you include `myapp`, the database name in the `test.yaml`configuration will be `myapp_test`, and in the `development.yaml` configuration, it will be `myapp_development`.

```
$ docker run -d -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=loco -e POSTGRES_DB=myapp_development -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD="loco" postgres:15.3-alpine
```


Now `cd` into your `myapp` and start your app:

```
$ cd myapp
$ cargo loco start
Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 21.63s
    Running `target/debug/myapp start`
